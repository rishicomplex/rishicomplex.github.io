Last week, I had the chance to spend a morning with a group from the Hadzabe tribe in Tanzania. This is one of the few  hunter-gatherer tribes left in the world.

This was a group of roughly 20 Hadza. Our guide was an ex-member of the tribe, who said he'd been taken from the tribe at a young age by a Spanish couple and attended English schools. 

When we came upon the group, the men had just finished a successful hunt, having killed an impala. They were sitting in groups, harvesting the impala's corpse. Its head had been placed in the wedge of a tree. One group was barbecuing its meat. Another group was laying out its skin to dry and be made into clothing. Yet another group was separating tendons from its bones to use as string.

I could immediately tell that this was going to be an unusual experience. Many "cultural" experiences like this feel rather staged, with the tribe members making the guests the center of attention and putting on a bit of a performance. The Hadza barely noticed we were there. It seemed like they were busy doing exactly what they'd be doing if we weren't there. They seemed to carry themselves with a lot of self-respect.

After a while, some of the men came over and greeted us. Several of them were dressed in the skins of animals they'd killed. Their leader, who we later learned was also the best hunter, was adorned the most, and radiated an aura of gentle power. Some of them were wearing pants and slippers, which we were told were some of the few things they'd picked up from the modern world.

Some of the men were about to go on a hunting/gathering trip. One of them gave us a description of what was going to happen, in the Hadza language.

The Hadza speak an interesting sounding language, with a lot of clicking and sucking sounds. Their language is an isolate - it is unrelated to any of the languages in the neighboring regions. They seem to have kept to themselves for a very long time, which may also explain their lack of interest in changing their lifestyles even as all the tribes around them have begun to modernize.

Three men and one child set out on the trip, and we tried to follow. Within minutes, I had a
