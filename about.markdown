I'm a researcher working on LLMs at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/).

Before this, I worked on reinforcement learning at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). I co-led [AlphaProof](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/), where we got an LLM to teach itself enough math to get a silver medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad, _almost_ cracking the [IMO grand challenge](https://imo-grand-challenge.github.io/). I also worked on post-training [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/).

Before DeepMind, I worked on improving Google's search ranking algorithm with deep learning.

I live in San Francisco. You can find me [on X (Twitter)](https://x.com/rishicomplex), or email me at [rishicomplex@gmail.com](mailto:rishicomplex@gmail.com).
