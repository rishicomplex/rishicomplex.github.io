I'm a researcher working on getting LLMs to reason via reinforcement learning at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). Most recently, I worked on [AlphaProof](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/), where we got an LLM to learn enough math to get a silver medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad, _almost_ cracking the [IMO grand challenge](https://imo-grand-challenge.github.io/).

Previously, I worked on improving Google's search ranking algorithm with deep learning.
